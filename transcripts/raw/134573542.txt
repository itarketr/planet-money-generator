TIMOTHY GEITHNER: The housing market is still in crisis. And we have to make sure that we proceed very carefully to avoid adding to the many burdens still on this market and with care not to disrupt the economic recovery now underway.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE CALCULATION")REGINA SPEKTOR: (Singing) You went into the kitchen cupboard, got yourself another hour. And you gave half of it to me.DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm David Kestenbaum.CAITLIN KENNEY, HOST: And I'm Caitlin Kenney. Today's Tuesday March 15. That was Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner you heard at the top talking about winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.KESTENBAUM: On the podcast today, we are going to pull one from the PLANET MONEY vault. We're going to replay one of our favorite podcasts where we talked to an efficiency expert about how he shaves in the morning. But first, today's PLANET MONEY Indicator from Jacob Goldstein.JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: Today's PLANET MONEY Indicator - 20 trillion. Japan's central bank has spent more than 20 trillion yen in the past two days. That's about $250 billion, a record-breaking amount of money for this kind of thing in Japan. And what Japan's central bank, the Bank of Japan, is doing basically is buying up lots and lots of the short-term debt that banks and ordinary companies need every day just to stay open and keep operating. In financial journalism, they call this injecting liquidity. That's what this means. And it's important because when investors get really scared, like now, say, finance markets can seize up. And all of a sudden, companies just can't do that basic financial stuff they have to do to stay open.KESTENBAUM: And 20 trillion yen - that's a big number. You were talking to a guy who's sort of startled - an economist, right?GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. As I called him, he was sort of looking it up. And he was definitely, you know, taken aback by the volume. Although he definitely said it's appropriate. It's what the banks should be doing right now.KESTENBAUM: So the - you know, obviously with the earthquake and the tsunami and - I was just thinking today about all the workers at the nuclear plant who are putting their lives at risk to try and bring those things under control. You know, monetary policy is not the thing everyone's talking about. But it is certainly true that central banks play a critical role in keeping the rest of the financial markets functioning during a crisis like this. And the Bank of Japan is aware of that.GOLDSTEIN: That's right. And, you know, clearly, in Japan, the stock market has fallen a tremendous amount this week. It was down by 11 percent just today. But the country's financial system is still functioning. Banks are still operating. Companies can still get the money they need to run their businesses and pay employees. So, you know, at the most basic level, it does seem like what the Bank of Japan is doing does seem to be working.KENNEY: All right. Thank you, Jacob.GOLDSTEIN: Thanks.KESTENBAUM: OK. So for today's podcast, we are going to rerun one of our favorites from last year. This is a conversation we had with one of our PLANET MONEY listeners, Matt LeBlanc.KENNEY: Now, I know what you might be thinking. No, we did not talk to Joey from "Friends" sadly, although I'm sure he's a huge fan of our podcast. But actually, the Matt we did talk to you has a really interesting job. And in some ways, it's a lot more fascinating than acting on a sitcom.KESTENBAUM: Yeah. It's a little obscure. But he says once his job - once, it actually made it into a movie.MATT LEBLANC: If someone asked me what I do for a living, I say, you ever seen the movie "Office Space?" And they go, yeah. And I'm like, yeah, I'm the two Bobs.KENNEY: So if you haven't seen "Office Space," you really need to go out and rent it 'cause it is just - I love it. I think it's such a funny movie. And in the movie these characters, the two Bobs, are these efficiency experts. And they come into this software company where the main character works. And the main character's depressed. His life is like basically like a "Dilbert" cartoon every day. He has a million boxes and a million little annoying tasks to do. And then on top of it, these two efficiency experts come in, the two Bobs. And they're there to interrogate everyone about what they spend their day doing.(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "OFFICE SPACE")JOHN MCGINLEY: (As Bob Slydell) So you must be Peter Gibbons. Uh-huh. Terrific. I'm Bob Slydell. This is my associate Bob Porter.RON LIVINGSTON: (As Peter Gibbons) Hi, Bob, Bob.MCGINLEY: (As Bob Slydell) Why don't you go ahead and grab a seat and join us for a minute or two? You see, what we're actually trying to do here - is we're just - we're we're trying to get a feel for how people spend their day at work. So if you would, would you walk us through a typical day for you?LIVINGSTON: (As Peter Gibbons) Yeah.MCGINLEY: (As Bob Slydell) Great.LIVINGSTON: (As Peter Gibbons) Well, I generally come in at least 15 minutes late. I use the side door - that way, Lumbergh can't see me (laughter) And after that, I just sort of space out for about an hour.PAUL WILLSON: (As Bob Porter) Space out?LIVINGSTON: (As Peter Gibbons) Yeah. I just stare at my desk, but it looks like I'm working. I do that for probably another hour after lunch, too. I'd say in a given week, I probably only do about 15 minutes of real, actual work.KESTENBAUM: And, Caitlin, this is actually a real job. It's called - you're an efficiency expert or a lean expert. And our real efficiency expert, Matt LeBlanc, works for this giant, global logistics company. And he basically tries to find all the little ways that people waste time or ways people don't do things in the most efficient way.KENNEY: And, David, you and I called him up and said, tell us a little bit more. This sounds really interesting. And it actually turns out his process is really scientific. He uses a stopwatch and does all these calculations. And he has this huge white board where he's drawing out boxes and arrows. And when he wrote to us, he said, let me give you an example - something that's easy to understand. Imagine Adam Davidson, our own dear Adam of the PLANET MONEY team is working at Starbucks. And it's his job to make lattes all day long.LEBLANC: Let's say that Adam Davidson is making lattes, and that I show up, and I cycle time him. And I go, listen. OK.KENNEY: And when you say cycle time, you're just standing next to him with a stopwatch.LEBLANC: Yeah. I'm not standing right next to him, but I am standing somewhere where I can see what he's doing. And I'm standing there with a stopwatch. And I'm recording the amount of time it takes. And then I say, OK, after about 10 to 20 observations of you just doing your job and making lattes, Adam, it says that you've done - it takes 124 seconds to do that latte. And he goes, OK, fine. That's fine. Now you do 100 lattes each day. Now, if I times 124 seconds times 100, and I get - what is that? - 124,000 seconds. Now I divide that by 3600, and I think I'm around about three to four hours it takes you. So I'm saying that it really - if you just did what the amount of average volume for that day, you'd only spend four hours working each day. But I spend eight hours paying you. So there's these four hours in the day. And you'd essentially be 50 percent efficient. If it was four...KESTENBAUM: So you're saying, I know how many lattes you do - you make in a day. But that's only four hours. Like, what do you do in the other four hours?LEBLANC: Yeah. And when I ask that question, that's when the yelling starts.(LAUGHTER)LEBLANC: Yeah, it's an honest thing because people don't usually think that way. People don't think in hours. They think in days. I show up. I do my job. I go home.KESTENBAUM: So, Caitlin, Matt is - he's kind of like a special ops guy, right? His company helps ship things all over the world? And they're always trying to find ways to save money. So they just drop him at one of their locations, and they say, OK, you've got to find some way to save us $500,000, a half a million dollars. And you got eight weeks to do it. And when we talked to him, he had just come back from this trip.LEBLANC: I was just in Mexico. And so for one of our clients there and one of our customers is that we ship MP3 players. You know, we distribute them throughout the entire Mexico City area. So, you know, I'm standing in the warehouse, and I'm looking at this process. And I have to spend a lot of time just standing in warehouses, looking weird staring at people moving boxes. And I see the truck back up. And they open the door, and they have to take all these boxes out. And then they move them, and then they pick them up and they put the box in one part. And then they go, and they do something else. And they'll come back, and they'll pick the box up for no really apparent reason and just move to another spot because they're working. They think they're working. And then finally, they'll break it open. They'll count everything. And then they'll take all these iPods, and they'll dump them out. And then they'll touch them again.And then I go, OK, listen, guys. Hold up. What if we tried something? What if you pick up that box from the truck, and you do the entire process from A to B until it gets into where it's supposed to be, and you don't pick it up again? And they said, ah, you can't do that. I mean, there's all these things that you can't do. I'm always told the things you can't do with these processes. And I go, listen. Let's time it. You do it my way, and it works, we'll do it. If it fails, then I will back off, and I won't bother you anymore.So it's me and a whole bunch of us warehouse workers with stopwatches. And we're timing people. And they're doing it again. And finally it's, you know, midnight, and we finally get it to work. And it saves about half the time. And that was - you know, that's the kind of - that's the good stuff about my job - is you get to do that. And everyone, oh, you see that little light flicker above their head. And they go, wow, I can't believe it actually worked. And I go, yeah. So why don't we do that with everything that we do?KESTENBAUM: So just so I understand - so they were taking the boxes out of that truck, and they'd move them somewhere. And then they'd take the truck away. And they'd go do something else. Then they'd say, OK, now we've got to move the boxes over here. But you're saying every time you bend over, pick up the box and put it down, like, that's wasted time, right? You want to pick it up and move it where you want it to be eventually.LEBLANC: Exactly. We actually call it waste. There are eight types of waste that we talk about.KESTENBAUM: (Laughter) You've categorized it.KENNEY: Wow.LEBLANC: The acronym is Tim T. Wood. It's transportation, inventory, motion, talent, waiting, overproduction, overprocessing and defects.KESTENBAUM: (Laughter).KENNEY: Nice.KESTENBAUM: Caitlin, the amazing thing to me about this story is that Matt found a way he could save 50 percent of labor costs - 50 percent. I mean, it's incredible that there would be so much inefficiency out there still, right? I mean, it's a really competitive world, a really competitive economy. You would think that every company would be trying to tighten things up as much as possible. And yet, there's still all this room for improvement.KENNEY: And that's exactly where Matt comes in. That's the happy part of his job. So he gets to go in, watch people doing their jobs and say, hey, if we change this things will work better. And then it makes everyone's job easier. And then the best part is he gets to call his bosses and say, listen. If we do things this way, I'm going to save you hundreds of thousands of dollars, which they love. And sometimes, the things that he suggests to make these changes are just really simple, basic things.LEBLANC: And we also move a lot of printers. Like, if you - I mean, I'm sure you guys have printers in your your office, right?KESTENBAUM: Yeah.LEBLANC: Have you ever thought about why that printer is there, and if it makes sense for it to be there?KENNEY: Like, in this specific location, you're saying?LEBLANC: In this specific location. If you have some people who have more stuff to print, do you move it closer to them? Like, this is the stuff that I have to think about. I have to go, listen. I can save you almost 2,000 hours' worth of labor hours if you take that printer from where it is over there and move it across, you know, the room. You will save that many hours. And people never believe me. But you can show it with all sorts of different calculations.KESTENBAUM: Just the amount of time, like, me walking across the room to get pieces of paper from the printer every day.LEBLANC: Exactly. Because your walking is transportation waste, and waste is not - is time you could be doing more productive things.KESTENBAUM: Yeah, but you know what? I have my greatest ideas walking to the printer.LEBLANC: No, I mean, it's - you know, you say that. Now, imagine that you actually did it. And when I move those printers, or I move people's desks to make them more efficient, I mean, that's when I started getting yelled at. That's when people start making physical threats. It's really bad.KENNEY: Physical threats?LEBLANC: Yeah, I've been physically threatened in a meeting once by someone because I moved their desk from one side of the room to the other because they didn't like the fact they couldn't see the window anymore.KESTENBAUM: Why'd you move his desk?LEBLANC: That was very young in my career. And I was - I just walked in there. And I do this thing - it's, you know - it's this horrible term. It's called gemba. And I just stand in one spot, and I watch people doing their work for, like, an hour. I'll just watch. I'll see how it goes. And I just saw this guy get up and walk back and forth and back and forth. And I go, well, OK. I see that, and I just instantly - you know, all my, you know, neurons start firing. I'm like, transportation waste. I can move that guy, do this. And I moved him over here. And then I just ran with it. And I went up to his managers. And I said, listen. I showed them the calculations I'd done. I said, listen. This is how much we can save if we do this.LEBLANC: What did this guy say to you? What happened? He said I'm ruining everything. He said I don't understand this - you know, these desks were set up for a reason. And I can't - you can't just come in here and move people's desks. And, I mean, the sad thing is that I empathized with the guy. Imagine if someone came in - and I look like the Gerber baby - like, imagine if the Gerber baby came in and told you to move your desk and, you know, didn't really explain to you well enough pr didn't sell it to you well enough and just made you do it. And that's probably the thing I've learned the most - is that you can't just move people's desks. You can't just move people's staplers. You have to bring them along because if you don't, then you'll get physically threatened.KESTENBAUM: How did he physically threaten you?LEBLANC: He came after me. And his fellow employees had to stop him from killing me.KESTENBAUM: (Laughter) And you both worked for the same company.LEBLANC: We both worked for the same company, yeah.KESTENBAUM: And, Caitlin, this is one reason why there are all these inefficiencies out there. It's that, sometimes, Matt's advice is hard to follow. It takes work to implement. So, you know, it requires people being really determined about changing the way they do things and change - sometimes, changing the way they've done things for years.KENNEY: And beyond just pissing people off by saying, hey, I'm going to move your desk, there's actually a dark side here, which is that in that movie that we talked about, "Office Space," the two Bobs, the efficiency experts - they come in, and they end up firing a bunch of people because they say, oh, we've actually determined your job isn't that important. One of the main bosses in the movie - they realize he's just carrying one piece of paper from one side of the office to the other.KESTENBAUM: (Laughter).KENNEY: So people do think about that when they hear Matt is coming. They worry that he's going to find something in his numbers, in his calculations that means they're going to lose their jobs.KESTENBAUM: Matt says, OK, you know, what I do - it does give managers ammunition that they could use to get rid of workers. But from an economic point of view, that's actually good - right? - because if a company can do something more efficiently, that means the product they make is going to be cheaper for me to buy and also means those workers can go and do something that's actually really useful. And that would make the whole economy stronger. But yeah, it's got this dark side.KENNEY: And Matt is optimistic about his work. He definitely thinks he adds value. And he makes some pretty decent points, one of which is that he says if he doesn't do this, the company is going to struggle. So at some point, they're going to have to fire people anyway. And without this information, they're going to fire the wrong people. There's people they're actually still going to need. And those people will end up getting fired along with everyone else.KESTENBAUM: Right. They won't know, like, who's necessary and who isn't or what part of what they do is necessary. And he makes this other point, which is that, look. You don't have to fire people if you find out they can do their work in half the time, right? If you find Adam's got four hours not making lattes, you don't have to send him home. You could tell him to sit down. And you could have him brainstorm ideas for making the process even more efficient. So maybe Adam would figure out he should keep the chocolate sprinkles right next to the milk steamer or whatever. But it does seem like at the end of the day, if you make things more efficient, you probably do need fewer people.KENNEY: But as much as Matt finds people who are maybe - there's extra time in their day - he also finds people who have all this hidden talent that isn't being taken advantage of. He told us a story of this one guy who worked at a company. And the guy had memorized these, like, 11-digit codes for every piece of cat and dog food in the building, which is kind of crazy. It was a photographic memory. But beyond that, he just really understood the process more than some of the current managers. He just knew where things were and how they went wrong, and he was just a temp at the time. So Matt was able to say to his bosses, hey, look. If you guys want to hire a supervisor, maybe this is your guy. You should give him another look. And so that was good for that specific employee. And then it's good for the company as a whole.KESTENBAUM: The thing about Matt's job that I think is a bit hard for him is that once you start seeing the world in this way, once you're professionally trained to look for inefficiencies, you realize that they're everywhere, that we live in this really messy, untidy world. And so when Matt's out, it makes him really happy just when he sees one little thing that's done well.LEBLANC: Have you ever been to Hooters?KENNEY: I'm sad to say yes, I have been to Hooters.KESTENBAUM: I have not. I've walked by. I can't even look in the window.(LAUGHTER)LEBLANC: So you know that system where they attach, like, a little piece of paper to that zipline, and they zip it to the cooks.KENNEY: Yes.LEBLANC: That's really efficient. I was at a restaurant with other lean experts. We saw that, and we said, that's kind of cool. And so the next assignment that she went on, she implemented that.KESTENBAUM: She stole it from Hooters.LEBLANC: She stole it from Hooters. I hope there isn't going to be any copyright on this. But yeah.KESTENBAUM: (Laughter).LEBLANC: She essentially stole the idea. And, yeah, it's - you know, that's what you look for. You're at - those little light bulbs come on. You have the little eye contact with the other lean experts, like (whispering) that's a really cool idea. We could steal that.KESTENBAUM: So you spend your day thinking about how to make things more efficient. Can you turn that off when the day ends, and you go home? Or does cooking dinner become this kind of mechanical process that you can't stop thinking about how to make more efficient.LEBLANC: David, I got to tell you, buddy. I've - there's this thing called 5S. It's called - it's sort, straighten, sanitize, standardize and sustain. And that's essentially a workplace organization tool that we use - why you'd move your stapler a certain way.KESTENBAUM: OK.LEBLANC: I 5S my toiletries in the morning. I have...KESTENBAUM: Oh.LEBLANC: It's so bad. I have - all of my toiletries are lined up in the order that I use them so that I have an order. It's a standardized process. And I follow that every single time I wake up, so I don't miss anything. And I - you know, I do that. And here's the thing, though - is that I tell that story to people. Like, I say, listen. I am a nerd about this. I do this. And I tell them that. Listen. That's not - doing that is not important. I mean, that's not an important part of my day. It's like, if I can get that out of the way, and I can do it in the most efficient way possible, I can get to the fun stuff more quickly. I can get to the, you know, drinking coffee, talking with my friends. So, I mean, it sounds funny. But really, I've - you know, I save time in my life that I can do the things that are actually, you know, value add and things that I actually care about.KESTENBAUM: Yeah, but then you've got to make the coffee in the most efficient way. You got to have the conversation in the most efficient way.LEBLANC: And then you got to tell people about it. Like, if you move that coffee maker, like, a couple feet, you could save a lot of time.KESTENBAUM: (Laughter).LEBLANC: And they look at you like you're, you know, deranged.KESTENBAUM: How - you said it's important to turn it off. How do you turn it off?LEBLANC: Music, you know, hanging out with friends, heavy drinking.KESTENBAUM: That to me is the hard question - not really how to be efficient. It's how to stop thinking about being efficient.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE CALCULATION")SPEKTOR: (Singing) Counted up our feelings, and divided them up even. And I call our calculation perfect love. Didn't even know that love was bigger. Didn't even know...KESTENBAUM: As always, we would like to hear what you thought of today's podcast. You can send us email - planetmoney@npr.org.KENNEY: You can also message us on Facebook and Twitter. I'm Caitlin Kenney.KESTENBAUM: And I'm David Kestenbaum. Thank you for listening.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE CALCULATION")SPEKTOR: (Singing) So we made the hard decision. And we each made an incision past our muscles and our bones, saw our hearts were little stones.

DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST: Hey, everybody. It's David. A couple weeks ago, we replayed one of our favorite episodes. It was about how we had set up our own offshore shell companies to try and figure out how these things work and what people do with them exactly. So we thought today we would replay the conclusion to that series so you can hear how it all came out. You're going to hear Chana Joffe-Walt and me. Here it is.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)CHANA JOFFE-WALT, HOST: We got something really exciting in the mail recently. It's right here. Two packages came in the mail containing all the legal paperwork for the two shell companies that we recently formed. We have one in Delaware and one in Belize.KESTENBAUM: We kept hearing about these tax havens, about how so much of the world's wealth is stored on these little islands.JOFFE-WALT: So we were wondering, how does it work, and can we get it on that? It turns out, yes, indeed, we can get in on that, incredibly easily, actually. Within a few days, we had opened up a shell company in Belize. We named her Unbelizable.KESTENBAUM: And once we did that, a little pink in the cheeks from our success, we heard about another tax haven. This one isn't even offshore. It's Delaware - no ID, no passport required, nothing. Twenty-four hours later, we owned Delawho? Does it actually have a question mark at the end?JOFFE-WALT: It does. And the whole thing, I have to say, felt really exciting. It felt like all of a sudden we were welcomed into this secret, shady world, and now that we were inside, we could learn all of its tricks. We were promised in the process again and again that no person or government would ever find out that we owned Unbelizable. Anyone coming after us was going to need a court order before the people in Belize would turn over any documents. And we could appoint fake directors and shareholders so our names were nowhere to be found in the paperwork. It was honestly - it was just as secret and sketchy as I had always imagined, and it was way easier to take part in it in this whole world than I expected.KESTENBAUM: And then the mail came with these piles of documents, one in an envelope, one in a big FedEx box. And Chana, this has all been just sitting on your desk for a month now. I would walk by them multiple times a day. We've just been kind of looking at them, not knowing what to do next.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)JOFFE-WALT: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Chana Joffe-Walt.KESTENBAUM: And I'm David Kestenbaum. Today on the show, tax lawyers to the rescue, we visit two experts and find out that in addition to buying these two companies, we may have also bought ourselves a world of trouble.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KESTENBAUM: So we took all the stuff we got in the mail, and we took it to some lawyers, these guys at Rogin Nassau at Hartford, Conn. We met with David Buckley there and Daniel Gottfried. They're specialists in this whole offshore world that we'd just gotten involved in. We sat down in a conference room. There was a fruit plate.JOFFE-WALT: There was. It was good. And Daniel and David basically just walked us through what we had just bought, starting with our Delaware company.DAVID BUCKLEY: So we have a three-ring binder that's burgundy and black in a gold inlay, and it says Delawho? LLC on the binding, looks pretty serious, certificate of organization, operating agreement.JOFFE-WALT: It really feels like I'm, like, in fifth grade, and my mom went to the store and got, like, a company kit for me to practice running a business.BUCKLEY: No, I - absolutely, absolutely. This is your toy company.KESTENBAUM: At this point, we took out the toy we were most excited about.JOFFE-WALT: They came with these.KESTENBAUM: The Delawho? corporate seal, we got one from Belize, too. It cost us a little extra. They are these awesome stamps. You put a piece of paper in, you just squeeze it, and it imprints this...JOFFE-WALT: All right.KESTENBAUM: ...Seal, you know, this official, corporate seal for our company.BUCKLEY: They up-sold you.(LAUGHTER)BUCKLEY: You know, we don't usually get that for our clients.JOFFE-WALT: David and Daniel, I think, were highly amused by the two of us. So they basically sat down with Unbelizable and Delawho? and read through all the papers to try to understand all these legal documents that we got. And in doing so, they found a lot of stuff we didn't completely understand when we were calling Belize and Delaware and setting up these companies. So when we called Belize, we were told, you know, if you want to remain really, really secretive, you can choose what is called the nominee service. And that's basically where they find some random person who's a nominee to be the director of the company. So you can control the company, but your name isn't anywhere on the documents. So both of these companies happened to be in my name, but my name is not on any of the documents here. The names that are on the documents are these nominees. And when I asked the people in Belize who's going to be our director, they said Desiree (ph) is a popular choice. I said, who's Desiree? Apparently, Desiree is some woman that sits at the front desk downstairs in the office. And according to these documents that came with all of our registration papers, she's already held a company meeting.BUCKLEY: Here we have the minutes of Unbelizable.JOFFE-WALT: Great. What does that mean? There were - there was a meeting that happened already.BUCKLEY: Right, presumably. And Desiree has been appointed as the director. And if you flip the page...JOFFE-WALT: It says that this - there being no other business, the meeting was declared closed at 11:30 a.m.KESTENBAUM: There's her signature.BUCKLEY: Absolutely.JOFFE-WALT: We also opted for a nominee shareholder. And he shows up in the same paperwork, also, Humberto (ph) - I think I'm saying this right - Humberto Gregorio Barrera Mojica (ph).Humberto owns all the shares for Unbelizable, and it's directed by Desiree.BUCKLEY: Correct.JOFFE-WALT: So do I own the company, though, or do they?DANIEL GOTTFRIED: No, you do. You know, Humberto will do what you tell him to do, Humberto will give you back the share whenever you ask for it, and Humberto will make whatever decisions in the company that you tell him to make.KESTENBAUM: It's just a way of not having to put our name on that form.GOTTFRIED: That's basically right.JOFFE-WALT: What about Desiree? Will she do whatever I tell her?GOTTFRIED: As your director, I believe that's the case. I think it's that she does whatever you tell her, and you can remove her at your will.BUCKLEY: And if you look here, she's already executed an agreement for her resignation. That's signed but not dated.JOFFE-WALT: So she's given me a resignation letter without a date so that I can fire her whenever I want to.BUCKLEY: Exactly. So all you have to do is date it when you decide that she's resigning.JOFFE-WALT: I have never had this much power over two human beings that I don't know. These two people are, like, the public face of our company. And they're real human beings, but they're not supposed to act like real people. They're just supposed to be sort of, like, my avatars, you know, that move when I tell them to move and how I tell them to move.GOTTFRIED: I mean, you could give Desiree the title fake director. You can pass a resolution that Desiree, you know, she'll have the office of, quote, "fake director." That could be her official title. So if she signs something on behalf of the company, she'd have to write fake director after her name (laughter).BUCKLEY: You can put a resolution in that says, the fake director has to call you on your birthday.GOTTFRIED: (Laughter).KESTENBAUM: Can we have Unbelizable sue Delawho?BUCKLEY: Yeah, I don't think we've had a client ask if they can sue themselves.GOTTFRIED: I could think of one instance.(LAUGHTER)KESTENBAUM: We talked to Daniel and Dave about this for a while, and we asked them, like, what possible legitimate purpose could there be for having a company with a fake director? And they said, well - and they said they have had a client like this. You can imagine someone with some wealth who lives in an unstable country, where there are kidnappings and bribery and corruption. In that situation, it would make sense for that person to stash money out of the country in a place where the bad guys couldn't find it, in a business that doesn't have the person's name on it.JOFFE-WALT: OK, but suppose you don't live in one of those countries where you're worried about being kidnapped all the time. I can still think of something else you might want to do.How do we launder money with these two companies?BUCKLEY: (Laughter).GOTTFRIED: I don't know.JOFFE-WALT: How...GOTTFRIED: We've been asked a lot of wild things by clients, but you are the first people who've asked us how can you launder money.JOFFE-WALT: David and Daniel shrug and are sort of giggling for a minute, but then they do proceed to say, well...GOTTFRIED: I don't know. If Unbelizable is selling T-shirts and you have money from, you know, drug dealing or something, then maybe you say, I sold, you know, a thousand T-shirts, and that's why I have this money. I don't know. We really have not done any money laundering either directly or on behalf of clients (laughter).KESTENBAUM: We may be the first to ask Daniel and David about how to launder money, but it has clearly occurred to the people in Belize that that is what some of their clients are looking to do.JOFFE-WALT: There's a whole section, actually, in here, in the Unbelizable paperwork, that says, don't do anything illegal. Promise you will not do anything illegal.BUCKLEY: I had a good laugh when I spotted that. Under provision six, beneficial owner - that's you, Chana - guarantees that the company will not be used for the purposes of distributing drugs, money washing, financing of terrorism, production or distribution - and or distribution of kiddie porn and some other unlawful - illegal activity that you're promising not to run through Unbelizable.KESTENBAUM: It almost implies, like, there is a danger, that if we don't remind you, that you might finance terrorism or launder money or something, right?GOTTFRIED: They understand that some of their clientele may not be above board, and they want, you know, plausible deniability.JOFFE-WALT: But again, Daniel and David emphasized they do not help people launder money or do anything illegal with offshore entities. There are lots of legal reasons to have companies like these. They would repeat again and again as we spend time with them. For instance, they said, imagine, you know, you have a international T-shirt making company, and you have investors from Canada and Mexico and China, all over the world. So sure, you could set up your company here in the U.S. But if you do that, then the Canadian and Mexican and Chinese investors, they all have to file tax paperwork in the U.S. And sometimes it's just easier to set up the company offshore, have the company file all the paperwork. You know, the same amount of taxes gets paid, but ultimately, it's just less paperwork for all the investors.KESTENBAUM: And when you sit down and think about it, you know, where are you going to register your company, you might not want to set it up in China or Mexico. I mean, Belize, the Cayman Islands, this is what they do. They make it easy, cheap and efficient.JOFFE-WALT: Daniel and David told us, you see offshore used a lot, especially in one kind of business, in private equity, where you have a bunch of investors, potentially from all over the world, putting money into one pot to buy up companies. So private equity, that's a legal, legal use of this whole offshore world. But of course, that's not what, you know, offshore places are known for. They're known for an illegal use, supposedly for tax evasion.KESTENBAUM: When we started this, you know, I naively thought, OK, they're called tax havens, must just be that you move your money to some offshore company where you set up a company offshore, and you don't have to pay taxes. That turns out not to be true. You still have to pay taxes. In fact, that's how we met Daniel and David. When David heard our first show about buying these offshore companies, he got worried about you, Chana, because they're in your name. And he sent you an email.BUCKLEY: Oh, I just thought she entered a minefield of U.S. tax compliance obligations.JOFFE-WALT: It turns out that despite all the advertising we heard about how private and how anonymous these things are, I am actually legally required to immediately file paperwork with the IRS declaring the existence of my offshore company, even if it's doing nothing. I need to tell the IRS that I own it, which, of course, completely undoes the whole idea of having the anonymity. Failure to file this paperwork with the IRS, Daniel and David told us, will result in a fine.KESTENBAUM: And then if Unbelizable is seen as a controlled foreign corporation, it is subject to an anti-tax deferral scheme as articulated in subpart F of the U.S. tax code.BUCKLEY: So subpart F is the part of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended.(LAUGHTER)JOFFE-WALT: This is clearly fun for these guys. Anyway, I probably am going to have to fill out a 54-71 form, which looks pretty complicated. In fact, on page 14 of the instructions for the 54-71 form, there is a helpful estimate of how long the whole thing should take.BUCKLEY: The record-keeping estimated burden is 82 hours, 45 minutes.JOFFE-WALT: Eighty-two hours and 45 minutes.GOTTFRIED: They're notorious. They're notorious for underestimating those times, by the way.JOFFE-WALT: And that is not all.BUCKLEY: And learning about the law or the form, 16 hours, 14 minutes, and preparing and sending the form to the IRS is 24 hours and 17 minutes.JOFFE-WALT: And if I don't fill out these forms, I could be fined up to $10,000 a year.KESTENBAUM: Chana, I am so glad I was out of the office when we had to decide whose name these things were going to be put in.JOFFE-WALT: Yeah, I'm sure you are, David.KESTENBAUM: (Laughter).JOFFE-WALT: OK, so Unbelizable doesn't make it suddenly legal for us to evade our taxes. In fact, it adds this whole other realm of tax forms. But if we are willing to break the law and not pay taxes, if our intent is to evade taxes, Unbelizable could help us in that. It could make it harder for the government to catch me evading my taxes, not that I plan to evade taxes. But if I did want to, it might make it harder because, you know, after all, the company on paper is owned by a guy named Humberto and run by Desiree. Our names are nowhere to be found, which kind of makes me wonder...KESTENBAUM: How do we get caught?GOTTFRIED: Well, there are a lot of ways to get caught (laughter). Well, first of all, if you get audited, you may get caught.BUCKLEY: Scorned lovers and, you know, disgruntled employees are a great source of information for the IRS.KESTENBAUM: Nobody has good numbers on what people in the world are using these shell companies like ours with fake boards of directors and fake shareholders for. I mean, sure, there may be some people in dangerous countries trying to protect our money from drug gangs and paramilitary organizations and kidnappers, but, I mean, how many people can that really be? This service where you get a fake director, that's offered in a lot of tax havens. And for what?JOFFE-WALT: We figured there is at least one person who is perfectly positioned to shed light on this, and that is Desiree, our fake director, who, you know, as we know, directs a lot of companies, probably all over the world.KESTENBAUM: When we set up Unbelizable, we were upfront that we were reporters and that we wanted to document the process of setting up a company. And once we had Desiree and Humberto on our paperwork, we asked, you know, could we interview them, too? And we were told no. We asked again, asked the manager, and we were told again, no.JOFFE-WALT: So as reporters, you know, that leaves us kind of stuck. But as owners of Unbelizable, we had more options. Our tax lawyers told us, you want to meet these guys, write yourselves into the annual meeting.BUCKLEY: So we have here, the company may hold once every calendar year an annual meeting. You can amend this to say, the company shall have, if you want.KESTENBAUM: In Belize at her house maybe or something.BUCKLEY: Right, right, absolutely.KESTENBAUM: Would you guys help us write that?BUCKLEY: Absolutely.GOTTFRIED: (Laughter).KESTENBAUM: Do it. Let's do it.David tears out a piece of paper from his legal pad. He hands it to you, Chana, and gives you a pen. And then Daniel just starts dictating, like, off the top of his head.JOFFE-WALT: Yeah.GOTTFRIED: So, OK, so you could write, resolution of the members of Unbelizable, Inc.JOFFE-WALT: OK.GOTTFRIED: OK...KESTENBAUM: It's kind of amazing to watch him. He kind of leans back in his chair, looking up at the ceiling. He goes on for several whole paragraphs just off the top of his head. Pursuant to article 16, we hereby resolve as follows.GOTTFRIED: This is the, you know, this is the guts here. The company shall hold...KESTENBAUM: Instead of may.GOTTFRIED: ...Instead of may, it's annual meeting in Belize.JOFFE-WALT: In Belize.GOTTFRIED: And I think the crucial part is that you should say, you know, and Chana and David shall attend.JOFFE-WALT: Well, this is a run-on sentence.GOTTFRIED: That's OK. That's OK.JOFFE-WALT: Am I still going? OK.BUCKLEY: (Laughter).JOFFE-WALT: And...GOTTFRIED: And there you have it. And then you would send that.KESTENBAUM: Excellent.GOTTFRIED: There it is. And now it's the law. You have to go.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KESTENBAUM: That is how this podcast ended. We were so happy after we left Daniel and David's offices. The whole drive home, we were just, like, this is such a clever solution. We're going to get to fly down to Belize. We're going to get to meet our fake directors. We had written it into the rules for our company. Game over. Here is how things actually went down. What we're going to play you now is from a later podcast. You're going to hear Robert Smith talking to Chana and me.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)ROBERT SMITH, BYLINE: Joining us are the masterminds behind our shell companies. We have Chana Joffe-Walt and David Kestenbaum. So you sent this letter that you got drafted by the lawyer. What happened?KESTENBAUM: Can I say a word about the letter first?SMITH: Yeah.KESTENBAUM: Chana just wrote it on, like, a legal pad, you know, in really sloppy handwriting. It's the first time I've ever written anything legal on a legal pad. And I was like, you can't send that. You got to, like, type it up and send it to them.JOFFE-WALT: No.(LAUGHTER)JOFFE-WALT: We just scanned it and attached it to an email and sent it to Richard, the guy in Belize who sold us this company package that came along with the fake shareholders with Desiree. And he wrote me back to my email and said, in light of the unorthodox amendment, our manager is dealing with this matter, and we will revert to your query as soon as he returns from being out of the country. But I have to say, when we got this, I still thought that it was going to happen because I - the lawyers seemed really certain. Like, these people's one job is to do what you tell them to do. And so just tell them to meet with you, and they will meet with you. I still thought that it was going to happen.KESTENBAUM: I thought it was definitely going to work.SMITH: You thought it was checkmate. It was legal checkmate.KESTENBAUM: (Laughter) Yeah.SMITH: Because this is - it is your company, right?JOFFE-WALT: Yeah, and they actually were already having meetings. Like, the paperwork that we got, Desiree and Humberto had had a meeting to make themselves the nominees of our company.SMITH: And so?JOFFE-WALT: So then after a bunch of back and forth with Richard, where he was trying to clarify what exactly we were asking for and he kind of thought we wanted to come to Belize to be able to write it off as a corporate expense for a while...KESTENBAUM: Which is a great idea.JOFFE-WALT: Right. We said really clearly, no, we just - we want to meet with them, and we want the two of them to be in the room. And then Richard heard the podcast, and he basically wrote us and said, you totally mischaracterized what nominees do. These are nominees. There's nothing fake about them. They are very real. You opted for this service, and we charged you for it, and this is what they're meant to do, and there's nothing shady about it. And because you mischaracterized it and because you named Desiree and Humberto - you actually said their names on the air, and now that's out there in public - they're going to resign, and we need to give them new names for new director and shareholders.SMITH: Wait. You have to come up with the names.JOFFE-WALT: Yeah.SMITH: I thought that was part of the package.JOFFE-WALT: Exactly.KESTENBAUM: Yeah, well, we just sort of were like, oh, what do we do? What do we do? We didn't do anything. And so then they made Chana the director (laughter).SMITH: Which defeats the whole purpose of a shell company, right?JOFFE-WALT: Exactly. It defeats the purpose of having the secret, fake shareholders that are not actually you.KESTENBAUM: They sent as an official new certificate of incorporation. It says, this is to certify that Chana Joffe-Walt, holder of passport number blah, blah, blah is the registered proprietor of all common shares, signed Desiree Singh (ph), director, not fake director.SMITH: It's so sad. I mean, all you want to do is just, like, ask questions. What's it like to be on the board of - what? - a hundred companies, two hundred companies? We don't know.JOFFE-WALT: Yeah, and I just wanted to see what a meeting was like. Like, do they actually sit in a room and talk about Unbelizable business?SMITH: Yeah, they're not getting paid that much. Is it 30 seconds for a corporate meeting and then done, stamp?KESTENBAUM: I mean, Desiree is director of Lord knows how many companies.SMITH: (Laughter) Well, there's one she's not director of anymore.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KESTENBAUM: There you have it. That was the end of our experiment with offshore tax havens and shell companies, oh, except for the accountant. We had to pay an accountant to do Chana's taxes that year. It got pretty complicated for her. We do still have the cool embossing stamps for our companies Unbelizable and Delawho? I was very happy to find those in my desk drawer the other day. I plan to stamp all official PLANET MONEY documents with them. We always love to hear what you think. You can send us email, planetmoney@npr.org. Our show today was produced by Sally Helm. Thank you, Sally. I'm David Kestenbaum. Thanks for listening.

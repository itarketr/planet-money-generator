STEVE HENN, HOST: Hey, just a quick technical note before the show. We've been monkeying around with our podcast feed. One result for some listeners is you might accidentally download lots of PLANET MONEY episodes. If you're concerned that this might happen to you, you can find step-by-step instructions for how to avoid it on our blog at npr.org/money. We will also walk you through it at the end of today's show.Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Steve Henn.DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST: And I'm David Kestenbaum. Today we have a whole podcast following up on a study that Chana Joffe-Walt did for us a couple years ago. It's a story about a businessman with a problem. Here's an excerpt.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)CHANA JOFFE-WALT, BYLINE: After he developed the plan, got all the appropriate licenses, found a storefront, John Davis was ready to start his business. So he did - well, the thing you do. He walked into a bank and he said, I'd like to open a business banking account.JOHN DAVIS: Yeah. We went in, met with the local - I think he was district manager or something - shook hands, talked a little bit. You know, everyone was very curious about my business just because it is a little bit unique, I guess.JOFFE-WALT: Because of the pot?DAVIS: Yeah, because of the cannabis.JOFFE-WALT: John's business is a medical marijuana dispensary in Washington State. And for a good year or two there, after the bank opened his account, John's business really was like any other business. He had staff, suppliers, customers, he paid his taxes. Until one day, John got a registered letter from that bank.DAVIS: Saying we valued our relationship, however we are no longer working with businesses that have a cannabis component. Basically, they're saying you have 30 days to get out and we're not going to put ourselves in a position where you could owe us money.JOFFE-WALT: How do you run a business without banking services?KESTENBAUM: Good question. It's David and Steve here again.HENN: Chana did that story in 2012. And at the time, the only legal marijuana you could buy in the United States was medicinal marijuana.KESTENBAUM: A couple years later, now today, a lot of things have changed. In Washington State and Colorado, anyone can buy marijuana. It's been legalized for recreational use. In a bunch of other states, the police have basically said we're not going to bust you for small amounts of pot. And medicinal marijuana - medical marijuana - is legal all over the place in 23 different states.HENN: So in some form or another, marijuana is legal today in close to half the country. But if you ask the federal government - the people in charge of our banking system, our financial world - marijuana is still illegal.KESTENBAUM: Today on the show, we check back in with that guy who had his bank account closed and some other people who are trying to build a business in this weird gray area, where your state and your country cannot agree on what's legal.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "BUSY EARNIN'")HENN: So David, I went back to Seattle and hooked up with John Davis who Chana talked to a couple years ago.KESTENBAUM: What's the name of his company? It's something really boring.HENN: It's the Northwest Patient Resource Network.KESTENBAUM: Basically saying, don't look at me. I'm a normal business. I have nothing to do with pot. Give me a bank account.HENN: Right. I do some vague medical thing. They wanted to be as boring as possible.KESTENBAUM: So one of the problems he had when Chana talked to him was that he was basically running a cash only business 'cause he couldn't get any credit card companies to work with him. He had to put an ATM in the lobby of his building but no bank would fill it, so he had to put the cash in himself.HENN: Yeah, it's still there. It's still an all cash business. In fact, when I was there, one of his staff walked up holding this big brick - almost the size of a loaf of bread - of cash. She had expected an armored car to come pick it up, but it was a holiday weekend and they didn't show.Are they not coming today?UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I'm not sure that they're coming today.HENN: She was going to have to put it back in the safe.UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Hopefully they'll come Thursday.HENN: There's this cash safe built into the floor and it has like a one-way slot in it. But this pile of cash, this brick of cash, was so big it got stuck.UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: It won't fit through that little door. There we go. In there for pickup. Yay. Prosperity.KESTENBAUM: When you're running a business that operates with so much cash, it makes everything more expensive. Like, he's built these separate safes - one for pot, one for cash - 'cause you don't want your cash to smell like pot. And the whole place has been set up with like bank level security. He was worried about getting robbed. Has that ever happened?HENN: Well, once someone tried.DAVIS: We had one attempt, which was hilarious to watch on the video. (Laugher). You know, obviously they hadn't cased the joint. I mean, jeez, if you're going to be, you know, a criminal, be a professional.HENN: These robbers broke into the lobby of his business, but then they were faced with two inch bulletproof glass and steel doors. And then they set off all kinds of alarms.DAVIS: This block was lit up like Christmas. And they were all holding bags like they were going to come away with something. It was - and then they came in and they seemed to be surprised with the whole, you know, separation.HENN: You can see it in the video. They're freaking out. They're pounding on the bulletproof glass and they can't get through. And then they just give up and run. But, you know, every pot business has to be built this way - basically built like a bank.KESTENBAUM: Steve, so when we last checked in, he did have a kind of bank account but it was like a don't ask, don't tell bank account.HENN: Yeah, he called it a back door bank account. Basically where he wouldn't volunteer too much information through his bank and then hope they didn't find out what he really did. But banking that way is really awkward. I mean, even something as simple as making deposits is a pain. Danielle Bernhart is his partner and that used to be her job, actually taking the cash to the bank.DANIELLE BERNHART: And so what I would do is I would be very polite and say it's great day or whatever. And then I'd pull out my smartphone and start conducting business and be a little bit rude and let them go about their business. And I'll be very busy while making the deposit.HENN: You use your smartphone as a shield to prevent me from being like, oh wow, this is a lot of cash. Did you have a bake sale?BERNHART: I'm a busy woman and you are not going to interrupt me with chitchat.KESTENBAUM: This has gotten a little bit better. It is now possible in some banks to walk in and say I'm a pot dealer. I would like a business checking account. You know, I want little checks with the little logo and the name of my company, House of Ganja or whatever, so I can pay my taxes and pay my people.HENN: Right. I want to pay my employees or, yeah, pay my taxes. But it's actually a little bit more complicated than that. Right now there are only three tiny credit unions in the entire state willing to have conversations like this. And it is a long conversation.CARMELLA HOUSTON: It's pretty intense, actually.HENN: This is Carmella Houston. Basically, she runs the marijuana industry outreach program at the Salal Credit Union in Seattle. And she showed me their application just for a checking account.Wow that's a thick stack of papers. How many pages is that?HOUSTON: Well, some of this is - some of it's - there's two pages of information and then we have a checklist of documentation that we ask them to provide, which is quite long.HENN: Yeah. Let's go through it.KESTENBAUM: This is just for a checking account?HENN: It's just for a checking account. And there is this long list of questions.HOUSTON: Do you have an information security policy? And do you have a formal fraud control function? Do have transaction controls and velocity limits for authorized personnel? Do have an e-business risk management policy?HENN: That one - that question seemed crazy to me because you can't legally sell marijuana online on the Internet in Washington State. But Carmella Houston said that is the point. It was a way to test whether or not her clients knew that.KESTENBAUM: It's like a trick question.HENN: Yeah. And they ask other ones too.HOUSTON: We want to know if their company location has any of the following security access, security cameras, security alarms, 24 hour surveillance. The answers to those questions should all be yes. Armed guards or guard dogs? The answers to those two questions should be no. The State of Washington does not allow armed guards or guard dogs in any license location. And then we ask...HENN: So in some sense, this is like a quiz.HOUSTON: (Laughter).KESTENBAUM: Steve, I feel like the financial world is all about trying to do the opposite of this. You know, trying to make things simple, trying to hide all the complexity, all the mess, all the infrastructure from you. And here, it's like all painfully visible.HENN: Yeah, you know, banks are all about managing risk. And here there is this real risk that the federal government could step in and shut down your pot business, maybe even shut down these little banks. I mean, this is all just for a little checking account.KESTENBAUM: And what if you want to get a loan?HENN: Well, the Salal Credit Union has only made one loan to help one grower buy equipment. It actually might be the only bank loan ever in this entire industry in the entire country. Imagine an industry where no one can get a loan. You know what that looks like? It's actually kind of sad. It looks like an unfinished construction site.UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Right. Insulation will go in. These will be sheeted up. We can go ahead and paint everything. Plumbers have passed their inspection. Electricians have passed their inspection through this point.HENN: This is a warehouse in Anacortes, Wash. It's the North Coast Growers. This business has been started by these three guys - a former investment banker, a real estate broker, a data scientist. And their dream was to build, like, a state-of-the-art marijuana growing facility, supply all the other growers in that part of the state with, like, the best strains of pot.So I go inside. There are wires dangling from the ceiling. There's exposed plumbing, no walls. And it's looked like this for a year. And I feel bad for these guys. They were really nice. They invited me into their business. They're excited about this opportunity, right. But without loans, every marijuana company in Wash. and Colo. needs to raise their own money. When they run into problems, they're stuck. These guys have funded this entirely by raiding their own savings account. And together, they've invested something close to half a million.UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Well, let's just put it this way - my wallet and I are not on speaking terms right now.HENN: So you're basically betting this all - betting everything.UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: A large part of it. I mean, you know, I learned in high school economics a long time ago not to ever go full-in on anything, but let's put it this way - I took on quite a bit when I decided to leave a well-paying job on the East Coast to come live in Anacortes and grow weed for a living.KESTENBAUM: Steve, so one of the reasons that banks are normally willing to make loans is that if the loan goes bad, if you can't pay it back, there's something they can take. Like, if a business defaults on its loan, then they take the business's assets. But here, that's a problem.HENN: It's a huge problem, and it's kind of an obvious one, right. Like, no bank wants to repossess your pot crop. Wells Fargo doesn't want to seize a safe full of pot. You know, first of all, the feds could've already seized it. And secondly, they don't want to be in a position of having to try and sell this stuff, which is a federal crime to have.KESTENBAUM: It is amazing to me in hearing all this how much power the feds have in the situation. I mean, they haven't been running around shutting down businesses and arresting people. But quietly, they're just making it extremely hard for the pot economy to thrive. It's almost like they've put economic sanctions on these businesses in Wash. State and Colo. and all these other states. In big ways, these businesses are cut off from a lot of financial infrastructure.HENN: There is a place where it is possible for marijuana businesses to use banks. And I really wanted to see what that looked like. I mean, imagine this business but you can get a loan, you can take a credit card, hell, you can even sell stock, issue an IPO. This fantasy land exists on an island, actually, just outside of Seattle. I had to get on a plane; this tiny, little plane to get there.UNIDENTIFIED PILOT: Good morning, folks. Welcome aboard. Sorry about the delay today. We're going to try to get deiced here just as quick as we can and get out of here before the weather hopefully doesn't sock us back and we can't go anywhere again.HENN: We're going to - not some hippy commune, but it is a land of happy people. There's maple syrup, mounties.KESTENBAUM: Yeah, Canada.HENN: Yes. Vancouver Island on this tiny, little plane. And with me is this guy named Brendan Kennedy. He is the founder and CEO of a company called Privateer. It is a private equity company that's devoted to building completely legal, international marijuana businesses.KESTENBAUM: Canada is different than the United States because in Canada, medical marijuana, at least, is legal everywhere. And I mean completely legal. It is legal in the cities. It is legal at the level of the provinces. It is legal at the national level. It is just plain legal, no footnotes.HENN: Right. They have access to all the financial stuff. They're just like any other business. And the difference is startling. After we landed, Kennedy took me to his $25 million pot-producing facility. And he walks me inside and opens this door.Holy cow. Wow.BRENDAN KENNEDY: So this is a room that's about a week away from harvest.HENN: It's like this botanical garden designed for pot. The carbon dioxide levels in the air are being monitored. Every strain of marijuana in this room has special lights designed just for it.The light is just - it's really putting pretty blinding, and then you see those yellows and like the purple flowers.KENNEDY: You're right. It's bright. There's a couple different colors of the spectrum that we've sort of matched up to these particular strains. Our lighting engineers will tell you that this room is about 15 percent brighter than the equator at noon.KESTENBAUM: How big is this room?HENN: The room was maybe 60 feet deep and 50 feet wide.KESTENBAUM: That doesn't sound so big.HENN: No, it's not, but there were 50 other rooms like this in the building. The place was enormous. It was 60,000 square feet. You know, this is what Seattle pot businesses want to be when they grow up. In the U.S., everyone looks at you funny if you want to walk into a bank or try to get a lease and you're growing marijuana. Here in this little town in Nanaimo, they set aside a special industrial park, actually created special zoning just for marijuana businesses. And in the U.S., remember John Davis? He has these big piles of cash and safes everywhere. In this facility, there is no cash whatsoever.KENNEDY: You know, I've been to cannabis grows around the world, and I've been to dispensaries around the world. And most of them have a safe in their building. And then if you go to - you know, I've been to dispensaries in California where there's a, you know, there's a million dollars in a room. And that's really uncomfortable. You know, we don't have any of those problems in Canada. We have a federal bank. We have a merchant processing system. We take credit cards. So all of our security, our vault is for the actual product itself.HENN: Remember those guys in the U.S. who were waiting to put up drywall in their little grow house in Anacortes? They've been working on that project for 15 months. Kennedy has built this entire grow operation in Canada in less than a year. They nailed down a $3-million loan in just months to buy the land. His company has landed $75 million in new investment from venture capitalists and other big investors; actual investors putting money down. Right now, they're talking to an investment bank about building another grow house right next door like this one but six times larger. And he says, you just can't do anything like that in the U.S., not yet.KESTENBAUM: This is so insulting 'cause, you know, like, we invented financial engineering in America. This is what we do best.HENN: Yeah. And maybe our greatest export. But right now, Canada is just killing us. The U.S. is making progress. I mean, we're not to Canada's level yet. But John Davis and Danielle Bernhart, those partners, those folks we met at the beginning of the story with the fake shell company in the backdoor checking accounts, they just landed a real checking account with a new bank...KESTENBAUM: Woohoo.HENN: It knows exactly how they make their money. The president of the bank signed off, and there was actually a board vote.KESTENBAUM: Wait - they had to - the board had to vote on it?HENN: Yes. The board voted to give them a checking account. Here's Danielle.BERNHART: To celebrate our new banking that we're so excited about, we ordered the American flag with eagle checks that we're proud to give out.HENN: (Laughter). All red, white and blue and green.BERNHART: Yeah. Here we go. Yes, there we go. There's the eagle. We've got the stars and the stripes. And absolutely, exercising our rights as citizens of the United States to...DAVIS: ...To have banking.BERNHART: ...To have banking.(LAUGHTER)HENN: She is so proud of her checks.KESTENBAUM: That's the show, but do not leave yet. We want to give you a heads up about something. So we have had some problems with our podcast feed last week. A bunch of you had hundreds of old PLANET MONEY episodes download automatically to your phone or computer. We are very sorry about that. I know you love us, but that is probably more than you wanted.We've done a kind of temporary fix, which is just to shorten the number of podcasts in the feed. But we want to bring back some more of the old ones so that anytime you want to relive the breakup of the Austria-Hungarian currency umpire, union, whatever, you can do it. But just so you don't get flooded again with a huge number of PLANET MONEY podcasts, here is what you should do. If this was a problem for you, go to your podcast app. And under settings for PLANET MONEY, you need to limit the number of episodes. You can choose the most recent or three or five or even 10, just do not limit it by time as in, like, one day or past week, or you could get more than you wanted.If you don't understand this, please just ask us. Tweet us or send us a Facebook message or email. We will talk you through it. We will help you. You can also check out this handy step-by-step guide that we put together. It's on the blog, npr.org/money. Thank you and sorry.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "BUSY EARNIN'")JUNGLE: (Singing) Can't get enough.HENN: We'd like to thank Phia Bennin, our producer for the show.

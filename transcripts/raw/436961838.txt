DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST: Hey, everyone. It's David. Today, we are replaying one of our favorite episodes. This is a story about the U.S. government trying to rein in an entire industry and totally, utterly failing. The industry is alcohol. This is a show I did in 2010 with Robert Smith. Here it is.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)KESTENBAUM: Today, we're going to be talking about Prohibition. Robert, I brought this.ROBERT SMITH, HOST: You have a mason jar filled with a clear, white liquid.KESTENBAUM: Yup, this is - oh, here, I'll just pour you a little bit. Oh, it's thick. All right - oh, OK, so since we're recording this at noon and since this is probably a violation of NPR policy, I recommend just taking a taste.SMITH: OK, it's got kind of a bouquet of turpentine.KESTENBAUM: (Laughter).SMITH: It's gasoline taste...KESTENBAUM: (Laughter).SMITH: ...A little bouquet of hazelnut, too (laughter).KESTENBAUM: This is formally known as moonshine. This batch is legal, but economically, moonshine alcohol in general, it has an unusual characteristic, which is demand for it is very strong. It is what economists call inelastic, which means you can tax it. People won't change their drinking habits much. It turns out, as we learned during Prohibition, you can ban it, and people still don't change their drinking habits very much.SMITH: Yeah, so alcohol is inelastic. So is the gas you put in cars and coffee. You know, if you need coffee in the morning, you will pay a lot of money for it. But most other commodities are elastic. The demand changes. You know, for me, it's movies, personally. If you raised the price of movies a couple bucks, I'm going to stop going. In fact, I don't even go to 3-D movies because they cost a fortune now.KESTENBAUM: I'm glad I'm not your kid, man. Anyway, alcohol is different, right? So today on the podcast, we're going to show you how different it is, how the power of an inelastic good changed government, changed our tax code, and coaxed a future president into undermining the very Constitution he would swear to uphold. Stay tuned (laughter).(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Support for PLANET MONEY comes from Betterment.UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: With more than 95,000 customers...UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Betterment is an automated investing serve...UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: ...Providing personalized investment management and advice...UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: ...Powered by smarter technology.UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Whether you're saving for retirement...UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Or just building wealth...UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: ...Betterment is designed to save you time and money...UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: ...While working to improve expected returns and lower taxes.UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: No minimums...UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: No surprise fees...UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: ...Betterment, investing made better.UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Learn more at betterment.com/planetmoney.KESTENBAUM: The story begins, actually, in Georgia. And I ran into a woman named Sylvia Bishop Wright. She works for the local paper, and she lives in an area called the Cove, which is kind of down off back roads. And she told me about one guy in particular who used to drink moonshine there during Prohibition.SMITH: Yeah, not just a guy. He was soon to be the president of the United States, FDR.SYLVIA BISHOP WRIGHT: When Roosevelt was coming down here, he especially liked the moonshine in the Cove.KESTENBAUM: Roosevelt likes moonshine.WRIGHT: They call it stump juice because they'd hide it, you know, in the old stumps.KESTENBAUM: In a tree stump?WRIGHT: In a tree stump. They'd just hide it down there and cover it up. Am I telling things I shouldn't be telling?KESTENBAUM: I told her no, no, no, and then I thought, well, you know, we did write Prohibition into the Constitution.SMITH: (Laughter).KESTENBAUM: FDR would later swear to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. And later, she left me this voicemail.WRIGHT: Hey, this is Sylvia at the newspaper. And you know how you get to thinking about things, you know, when we were talking about the booze, you know, the stump juice and all and about how Roosevelt liked it. But I'm telling you I don't want anything said about Roosevelt that would be wrong. These folks down here will fight you about Franklin D. Roosevelt.KESTENBAUM: So people in this part of Georgia love Franklin Delano Roosevelt. I called Sylvia back. I figured I owed it to her and to Roosevelt to try and confirm this, see if it was true. I went to where FDR stayed when he was in Georgia. It's a little pine cottage. People call it the little white house. FDR liked the springs in the area. The place is called Warm Springs, Ga. Remember, FDR had polio. He was paralyzed from the waist down. But in the springs, he could float in the water and do basically physical therapy. So I asked people at the museum - the little white house is a museum now - I said, did FDR drink moonshine? And they said, yeah, legend had it that FDR drank moonshine, but they didn't know if it was true. So the park service woman gave me a map, and she circled this unnamed road, and she said that's the Cove. That's where FDR supposedly got his moonshine. So I got in the car, and I drove there, and I found a guy sitting on his porch who told me, I don't know, but you should - you know who might know? Aunt Nee. There's this woman everyone calls Aunt Nee, and she's the last living daughter of a man who was FDR's favorite fiddle player. So I drove over this little mountain, and then on the left, there was this white farmhouse. I went up, and I found her. Her niece let me in, a woman named Linda Carpenter.Hello, there.LINDA CARPENTER: Hey, curly burly. Here she is. Aunt Nee, what you doing?CORNELIA WRIGHT NEWMAN: Working a puzzle.KESTENBAUM: Aunt Nee's real name is Cornelia Wright Newman. She is hard of hearing, so the way the interview would work is I would ask a question in what I thought was a loud voice, and then Linda would shout it out even louder.How old are you, ma'am? How old are you?CARPENTER: How old are you?NEWMAN: How old am I? I'm 88 years old.CARPENTER: No, you 90. You're 90, going on 91.NEWMAN: I be 90, I be - no, yeah, that's right. I'll be - I'm 90.CARPENTER: And you going on 91.NEWMAN: Yeah.CARPENTER: You'll be 91 in August, sugar.KESTENBAUM: Aunt Nee told me, yes, she met President Roosevelt when she was a little girl. FDR loved her father's fiddle playing.So, Sylvia told me that FDR used to come here to the Cove to buy moonshine.CARPENTER: Did FDR come to the Cove to buy moonshine?NEWMAN: To buy moonshine? Yeah, he'd come down here to Uncle Charlie's old store, Gilbert's store down there, and that's where he met Daddy.KESTENBAUM: Did he buy moonshine? Did FDR buy moonshine there?CARPENTER: Did he buy moonshine at Uncle Charlie's old store, FDR?NEWMAN: Yeah, yeah, he tried it. He was over there one time when he'd come by, and he was over there to get his groceries from Uncle Charlie's. And he stopped, and he found out where Daddy lived, and he'd only played the fiddle, you know?KESTENBAUM: But, but...NEWMAN: And he'd come on over there.KESTENBAUM: But he bought moonshine, also, moonshine. FDR bought moonshine there?NEWMAN: I don't know if he did or not. I don't know.KESTENBAUM: You don't know.CARPENTER: I don't know, either.KESTENBAUM: OK.CARPENTER: 'Cause I was a little, bitty girl. I don't know if FDR bought moonshine or not.NEWMAN: I don't know, either. Didn't get it at my because my daddy didn't fool with it. Mama wouldn't allow that.(LAUGHTER)SMITH: I love it, David. You're like one of these, you know, investigators, government investigators coming searching for the still out in the woods, and she won't reveal where it is. Do you think that she actually knew or not or...KESTENBAUM: Someone there told me that when they bought their land, they found like a half dozen old stills out in the wood. So they're still out there these things. Clearly in Aunt Nee's house, drinking was wrong at the time, though, right? And that was the logic behind Prohibition. Look, it's harmful. Let's just pass a law against it.SMITH: Yes, but they were up against that unstoppable force of economics, the inelastic good. You can tax it, you can ban it, but people still want it.KESTENBAUM: I talked with Bruce Yandle, professor of economics emeritus at Clemson University. It turns out once Prohibition was passed, people did not stop drinking.BRUCE YANDLE: Well, there's an estimate that there were 25,000 to 30,000 speakeasies in New York City in the early '20s, for example, just operating away.KESTENBAUM: In the city?YANDLE: In the city.KESTENBAUM: I don't - I'm not sure there are that many bars now.YANDLE: (Laughter) Maybe the industry has gone down. It may have been more competitive, but a very efficient industry developed - illicit industry developed during this time.KESTENBAUM: Inelastic demand - so Bruce Yandle says people have actually studied what happened during Prohibition. The year consumption did go down because it was easier to police. Authorities would smash the barrels to make a big show, and the beer would go running down the street. But spirits and moonshine - that was much easier to hide, so consumption of spirits and moonshine actually went up.YANDLE: You could stick a fifth of Canadian in a boot and deliver it at a speakeasy without being seen. And so the higher the concentration of alcohol in a beverage, the better its chances during Prohibition. Now, when you look at consumption before and during and following Prohibition in terms of market share, you see that spirits made out like a bandit to coin a phrase that fits here.KESTENBAUM: So moonshine...YANDLE: A spirit...KESTENBAUM: Moonshine did well.YANDLE: And moonshine did well.SMITH: This is what economists call a substitution good. You can't get beer, you switch to something else that serves the same purpose.KESTENBAUM: When you talk to Bruce Yandle, it actually seems like a miracle that Prohibition passed at all - not just because people liked to drink alcohol, but the government liked it, too. The government liked to tax it.YANDLE: For many, many years prior to 1920, the federal government's principal source of revenue was the alcohol tax. From the late 1800s to the mid-1900s, alcohol taxes for the federal government represented as much as three fourths of federal revenue.KESTENBAUM: That seems incredible to me. That tells me either the taxes were very high or that we drank a lot.SMITH: Or both.YANDLE: Well, and the other thing it tells you is that our federal government was very small in terms of its expenditures (laughter).KESTENBAUM: Or that we didn't tax much else than alcohol, and that's why it was three-quarters, yeah.YANDLE: That's right.SMITH: And this makes Prohibition all the more surprising. I mean, how do you ban an industry that's propping up the U.S. government?KESTENBAUM: Well, you need another source of revenue.SMITH: Clearly.KESTENBAUM: You know how people always point to the 18th Amendment as establishing Prohibition, the 18th Amendment to the Constitution, you actually got to look two amendments higher on the list, the 16th Amendment, which provides for - sorry if this is giving you flashbacks to history class - provides for income tax.SMITH: The income tax, a revolutionary economic idea at the time. You don't just tax things at the ports or in the saloons. You go around to everyone and collect tax based on income - crazy idea, difficult to pull off, never happen. But it turns out it works. It works so well that politicians think, hey, you want to ban alcohol? Well, we can live without the revenue. We'll just raise that income tax a little bit.KESTENBAUM: Yeah, bad timing.(LAUGHTER)KESTENBAUM: 1929 stock market crash - we have the beginning of the Great Depression, no one has much money, the income tax thing is not working out so well, and lawmakers are looking at alcohol - the thing that used to bring in all that revenue - and watching it instead make a lot of money for mobsters.SMITH: Luckily for those of you who drink, there is a moonshine drinker running for the presidency.KESTENBAUM: Alleged moonshine drinker.SMITH: FDR - he does not have to say, hey, look - martinis taste great. Let's get wasted, everybody. No, he can make an economic argument.YANDLE: Part of the Democratic platform when Roosevelt was running for the office was if only given a chance, Americans might drink themselves into a balanced budget.KESTENBAUM: Meaning that if we legalize this and tax it, we will have enough money to balance the budget.YANDLE: Exactly.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROOSEVELT: We advocate the repeal of the 18th amendment.(APPLAUSE)KESTENBAUM: Robert, when I hear that I keep thinking that the applause sounds perfunctory. Like, no one - the audience doesn't sound very excited.SMITH: That's because they're still sober. They've been sober for years.KESTENBAUM: Not for long, though, because just a few weeks after FDR takes office, he signs a bill that legalizes beer. It's actually going to take the rest of the year to repeal the 18th amendment.SMITH: And think about how crafty this was. When FDR took office, the country was in the middle of its greatest economic crisis - banks were collapsing, there was a run on gold. FDR had to declare a four-day bank holiday just to stabilize the whole system. The nation was on the verge of panic, and FDR says, hey, everybody, have a drink.KESTENBAUM: So it's sort of like if President Bush had decided to legalize marijuana the day after Lehman Brothers collapsed.SMITH: Yeah, it would've taken the edge off the whole crisis. And you know, when I was listening back to newsreels from 1933 that's basically what FDR did. He took the edge off this whole crisis. And all of a sudden what was once a divisive moral issue became a brilliant business stimulus plan.(SOUNDBITE OF NEWSREEL)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: The decisive vote of the 36th state against prohibition is happy news for the grain raisers of the United States and for many others throughout the land. With an eye on December 5, work is being rushed in distilleries and bottling works. Thousands are being called back to work in plants and allied industries. At least 500,000 new jobs are predicted as a result of repeal. Drum, keg and barrel factories grabbed the most closely allied lines. Immediate benefits from repeal extend into almost every line of business and commerce. However...KESTENBAUM: So there you have it, a brief economic history of prohibition.SMITH: You have put together this entire economic puzzle, David, except there's still one piece missing.KESTENBAUM: What?SMITH: We don't know if FDR ever drank moonshine.KESTENBAUM: Oh, actually, I have one more piece of tape for you. I kept making phone calls after I got back from Georgia, and I found this man named Tom Wendland (ph). He's a local FDR buff and an actor. He told me he's actually played FDR.TOM WENDLAND: I have tried to put on the FDR voice from time to time.KESTENBAUM: So over the years Tom has gone to gatherings of people who actually knew FDR. For some reason the phone line here wasn't very good, so again, I had to shout.KESTENBAUM: Did Franklin Delano Roosevelt ever buy moonshine when he was in Warm Springs?WENDLAND: I don't know if he bought it. I know quite a bit was given to him.KESTENBAUM: How do you know that?WENDLAND: Testimony by people who knew him - for example, Bum Phillips, who is a neighbor in the Warm Springs area, brought quarts of moonshine from a still over in the Flint River area, and the Baptist preacher was coming into the little white house at one time for a rather unannounced visit, and they had to hurry up and hide the moonshine.KESTENBAUM: During prohibition?WENDLAND: Oh, sure. Oh, wait - no, I have to be careful with that. Yes, yes, during prohibition because the scene that I just described was one that occurred in the late 1920s during prohibition, yes.KESTENBAUM: So that would have been in violation of the U.S. Constitution?WENDLAND: Well, yeah. It was an amendment to the Constitution but it was - I don't believe that it was a constitutional crisis for an individual to drink it. It was a violation of the Constitution to manufacture and distribute it.KESTENBAUM: (Laughter) It sounds like you're trying to get him off the hook.WENDLAND: (Laughter) I think I'll go have a drink myself right now. I think I handled that beautifully.SMITH: I picture FDR sitting on the porch of his little white house sipping a moonshine martini and, you know, watching the sun go down over the trees and just hatching this brilliant plan.KESTENBAUM: I'm going to run for president and make this legal.SMITH: Exactly.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "RIVERSE")CULLAH: (Singing) I rush fast like the rapid river. A rough and heavy, steady flow.KESTENBAUM: Since we originally aired this show, Aunt Nee did pass away. She died in 2012 at the age of 93. If you'd like to raise a glass in her honor, we have a recipe online for FDR's martini. It calls for olive brine and, I would say, too much vermouth. You can find at npr.org/money. Let us know what you think. You can reach us on twitter - we are @PlanetMoney. Our show today was produced by Jess Jiang. Thank you, Jess. I'm David Kestenbaum. Thanks for listening.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "RIVERSE")CULLAH: (Singing) I don't know when enough's enough. Over the mountains, up to the heavens, I follow the current of the river's flow, of the river's flow. Here we go now, heed the river. Now we know we gotta heed the flow...

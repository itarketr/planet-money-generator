(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MITT ROMNEY: I made a commitment to my church a long, long time ago that I would give 10 percent of my income to the church. And I've followed through on that commitment.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "GOOD FEELING")ETTA JAMES: (Singing) Oh, sometimes, I get a good feeling, yeah. I get a feeling that I never, never, never, never, had before. No, no. I get a good feeling. Yeah.CAITLIN KENNEY, HOST: Hello and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Caitlin KenneyROBERT SMITH, HOST: And I'm Robert Smith. It's Tuesday, March 6th. And that was Mitt Romney you heard at the top talking about the amount of money he gives to the Mormon Church.KENNEY: That 10 percent gift is called a tithe. And on today's podcast, we're going to go deep into the world of religious tithing. Think of it as a flat tax you pay to God.SMITH: Now, plenty of religions ask for money, but the Mormons are extraordinary in their dedication to paying a tithe - so much so that they are teaching economists how people think about their money.KENNEY: But first, the PLANET MONEY indicator with Jacob Goldstein.JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: Today's PLANET MONEY indicator - 1.2. The eurozone economy shrank - yes, shrank, got smaller - at an annual rate of about 1.2% in the last three months of last year. This is according to numbers that the eurozone put out today. And just for a little context, you know, a reminder - here in the United States, we're worried right now - why isn't our economy growing faster? Why is the recovery so weak? But our economy - it's growing at about 3% a year. In Europe right now, to have a worry like that, that's a dream for them.SMITH: Now, no economy wants to shrink. That is not a good thing. But it's particularly bad in Europe because - I'm just going to say it, we have to say it - there is debt.GOLDSTEIN: Debt. We say Europe, we have to say debt.SMITH: Now, as we talked about at the podcast last week, Europe is riddled with debt. In fact, all the solutions that we've seen over the past few months to Europe's problems involve piling debt on top of debt. And that ends up being a problem when your economy is shrinking.GOLDSTEIN: Absolutely. And, Robert, if I recall correctly from that podcast last week, one of your four ways to get out of debt, I think your handy mnemonic was grow your GDP. In other words, make your economy get bigger because at any level of debt, the bigger your economy is, the easier it is to pay off that debt. So growing GDP, that's good news for the debt picture. What we have in Europe right now is shrinking GDP, which is bad news for the debt picture.SMITH: Thank you very much, Jacob.GOLDSTEIN: Thanks, guys.SMITH: And now onto the secret world of tithing. Churches are like any business. They have to keep the lights on. They have to, generally, pay for space, for their staff at least. Churches need money.KENNEY: But unlike businesses, they don't sell their main product - faith. Sure, they might have bake sales or the occasional raffle. But in general, they don't charge admission. They don't typically get money from the government. Their money comes mainly from their members, the people who believe in them.SMITH: Now, in order to encourage such generous giving, religions usually have guidelines, some sort of code that they pass on, some sort of way of saying that this is how much you should give. And every religion approaches this differently.SMITH: The Catholics have a pay-what-you-want approach. They pass the basket and you can drop in as much or as little as you want. Father Michael Perry of Our Lady of Refuge Church in Brooklyn says, historically, the Church hasn't needed to make the hard sell.MICHAEL PERRY: We've come from cultures where the culture maintain the church, where there wasn't even a need to tithe. You know, if the priest needed something, he simply got up and said we need a new roof and then he had the new roof.SMITH: So that's the Catholics. In Judaism, they are a little more specific about the level of donations. They give a number. Rabbi Joshua Metzger read to me from the Old Testament.JOSHUA METZGER: (Speaking Jewish) - which means, you shall tithe a tenth - (speaking Jewish) - all of your grain. It's a biblical obligation.SMITH: Of course, since we don't really use grain now, what they're saying here is that an observant Jew should give one-tenth of their income to some form of charity.KENNEY: In Islam, it's a different number - 2.5 percent of your wealth. It's called the zakat. And they have lots of rules about this. Imam Omar Abu-Namous of the Islamic Cultural Center of New York says it gets very complicated. You donate based on excess wealth. That could mean your savings account or this.OMAR ABU-NAMOUS: If a woman, for example, say, has jewelry and jewelry which exceeds the reasonable amount which she uses for embellishment, for decorate, you know, just to beautify herself, if she has more than that amount then she must pay zakat for that.KENNEY: By the way, I asked. The reasonable amount of jewelry for a woman to own - two pounds. Anything above that, you need to pay.SMITH: Now, when we talked to these three spiritual leaders, they all admitted that these are their principles of faith. But not everyone follows them. They still have to work their congregations, sometimes pretty hard, to cough up more money. This is the life of a religious leader in America these days.KENNEY: But when you look at the statistics, there is one religion that makes it look easy, that has a remarkable rate of success when it comes to getting people to donate. It is consistently at the top of the list.SMITH: It is the Mormons - The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And they use a unique combination of these techniques the Jews, the Catholics and the Muslims all talked about. The Mormons are, on one hand, extremely specific - 10 percent of your income. It is taught to Mormons at a very early age - 10 percent no matter what.DAVID SHAPIRO: I can't ever remember not knowing about tithing, probably 3, 4 years old. I did get a paper route when I was 9 or 10 years old, and I was paying tithing from all the income that I got from that as well.SMITH: This is David Shapiro (ph). And he is Mormon, as you might have guessed. He is also a financial planner who lives outside of Denver. And Shapiro says that although the amount of the tithe - 10 percent - is very specific, the Mormons really don't spell out the second half of the equation. Ten percent of what exactly? What should be considered income? Your paycheck, that's obviously income but, I don't know, is a gift of money income?KENNEY: And for Shapiro, he struggled with this question when he met his wife. He'd always tithed on the total amount of his paycheck, you know, before taxes. But his wife?SHAPIRO: She paid tithing on the net of her income.SMITH: After taxes?SHAPIRO: After taxes. Her logic was, money that I pay to the government isn't money in my pocket, so I shouldn't have to pay tithing on that.SMITH: Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's.SHAPIRO: Exactly. And my feeling was, well, if you have the gross amount and you have to pay a certain amount for taxes, you wouldn't have had to pay that amount unless you had the income. So the income is what you pay your tithing on whether part of it goes to the government or not.SMITH: Shapiro says his wife eventually came around to his way of thinking. But consider what just happened there. Two devout Mormons, both brought up the right way in the church, had completely different ideas of what their church was expecting of them, two very different ideas about the definition of income.KENNEY: It's a tricky thing to figure out, which is of course why the IRS has thousands of pages of laws and rules and charts and tables - the Mormons, on the other hand, not so much. The leaders of the church specifically tell their members that they are on their own. It's up to their conscience to decide what is income.SMITH: And this can get very, very complicated when you try to break it down. If you find a $20 bill, do you kick $2 back to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?SHAPIRO: Yeah, I would.SMITH: What about capital gains? If you buy or sell stocks, is that also 10 percent?SHAPIRO: For me, personally, yes.SMITH: Dividends?SHAPIRO: Uh-huh (ph).SMITH: Interest on checking accounts?SHAPIRO: Right.SMITH: If you have a garage sale, would you tithe your results at the garage sale?SHAPIRO: All of the stuff that we sold at the garage sale has already been tithed because we tithe on gross, so probably not.KENNEY: Now, Shapiro has been doing this his whole life. He's had a lot of time to think it over. But it's sort of strange that he has to go through this process because normally, for the rest of us, income is defined for us. It's done by the IRS or even in economic statistics.SMITH: Yeah, but the Mormons are totally on their own with this decision. In the church, tithes are usually given in sealed envelopes. No one but your bishop knows what you're giving, so you can't sort of sneak over at your neighbor there in the pew and see what they're kicking in. And the church really has no enforcement mechanism. They ask once a year, have you given 10 percent? But they don't check up on you. You know, the church does not ask for your W-2 or your bank statement. They believe, when it comes down to it - this is what Mormons believe - that God is the perfect auditor. God knows if you're cheating him basically. And if you believe in God, there's no cheating on your tithe because technically he knows everything you're doing.KENNEY: This is why economists have gotten interested in Mormon tithing. There are lots of demands on our income, from the church to taxes. And looking at the way Mormons tithe is a chance to figure out how people think about what they keep and what they give away.SMITH: One of those economists that got interest in Mormon tithing is Gordon Dahl. He is a Mormon himself and a professor at UC San Diego. And he wanted to work through how Mormons think about tithing by doing a survey of members of the church. But he faced some challenges almost immediately because he said, there's no actual master list of Mormons you can look up and just call Mormons. So he did the next best thing. He started to call people randomly in Utah. And usually, as is the case in Utah, a Mormon answers the phone.KENNEY: Now, he says you can't just start out and ask people, do you pay tithe? How much do you pay in tithing? Because that makes people uncomfortable. It's a private, personal thing. You have to say in theory, hypothetically, in a perfect world.GORDON DAHL: We might ask, suppose your parents gave you $500 for Christmas. Would you pay tithing on that money?SMITH: Most Mormons in Dahl's survey said yes, gifts of cash are definitely considered income. So Dahl changed it up, made it a little more complex. He asked, what about a gift of furniture?DAHL: If your parents gave you, for example, a sofa worth $500, people wouldn't tithe the value of the gift. So in other words, we got our first glimpse of the way people think about income is, as I like to say, when they see green.SMITH: Cash money. So for simple questions, the Mormon conception of income isn't that different than the rules of the IRS. Dollars are easier to tax than sofas. And dollars are also easier to tithe on. It's easy to do the math.KENNEY: But the questions in Dahl's survey got harder, the calculations more complicated. And Dahl says he was amazed by some of the choices that people made with their tithing. They clearly weren't thinking of their income the same way the IRS does.SMITH: Yeah, so Dahl had a whole series of questions about stocks. When you sell stocks, normally you pay capital gains in the IRS world. And so he asked people if you tithe on stocks if you made a profit off of them. And, of course, most of them would say, yeah, I'll pay tithing on this. But if Mormons sold stocks and they lost money, Dahl found that Mormons wouldn't deduct the loss from their income when it came to tithing, the kind of deduction that would come as second nature if you're filling out your tax forms.KENNEY: Another unusual thing he noticed?DAHL: We asked questions about, suppose you're saving for retirement. Are you going to pay on the money you put into the account? Now suppose you're retired, what are you going to pay on when you take the money out of the account? Just the principle? Just the interest? The principal plus the interest or nothing? Most people pay when they put the money in and then pay on the entire amount when they come back out. So they've kind of tithed the principal twice, plus the interest earnings on the principal. So that seems a little odd to me because you've double tithed an intertemporal transaction, right? You've kind of tithed the principle when you put it in and you tithe it when you retire and take it out, plus you tithe the gain. And most economists would say, well, that would be double taxation.SMITH: At the end of the survey, Professor Dahl noticed a few patterns. He found that, in general, when Mormons faced a tough choice, they tended to go with the more simple definition of income, the more generous definition of income.KENNEY: He found that they really focused on cash in hand, when dollars showed up, regardless of where they came from or if they'd been tithed on already. It felt like new income. Basically, no one wants to trot out a lot of deductions when faith is involved.DAHL: They're worried about being petty with God. I don't want to be petty with God.SMITH: So all this works pretty well for Mormons and the Mormon Church. But what are the bigger lessons we can learn from tithing? After talking with Professor Dahl and with David Shapiro, there seem to be three take-home messages for anyone who wants to raise money effectively.KENNEY: No. 1, it helps to have something you believe in. Mormons were willing to take a generous view of income because, in the end, they like where the money is going. They trust the church. They trust that the church is going to do good things with their money.SMITH: Lesson No. 1, trust the giver. The Mormon Church could have told its followers exactly what income is and what it isn't. Oddly enough, if they had actually used the IRS definitions, they probably would have gotten less money. Plus, as one Mormon bishop told us, the soul searching, the real questioning over how much to give, that's kind of the important part. That's faith.KENNEY: Lesson No. 3, keep it simple. This was a very clear finding in Professor Dahl's research. Mormons, they didn't want to fool around with deductions and write off all these complicated things. The strength of the 10 percent tithe was that you could use your gut and do the math in your head.DAHL: So actually, their code is pretty simple. Now, it doesn't line up with the economists' view. It doesn't line up with the tax code, but I'm not sure either of those views are perfect.SMITH: It's this last principle - keep it simple - that Dahl feels might actually help out the IRS, of all organizations. The government will never generate the kind of faith that God does. That's obvious. It will never trust the average taxpayer to pick their own definition of income because...KENNEY: And they probably shouldn't.SMITH: Yeah, it would be a disaster. But simplifying the tax code - that, Dahl says, may be an enduring lesson from the Mormons.DAHL: I think when we get the tax system too complicated, there's always a backlash because people think that it's somehow not fair. Someone else is paying less than me because they have connections. People don't like that. They want a fair system is one thing I would kind of say. And a fairly simple system is what most people seem to think of as fair.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "GOOD FEELING")JAMES: (Singing) Oh, sometimes, I get a good feeling, yeah.KENNEY: As always, we want to hear what you thought of today's show.
